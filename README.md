Converts a numeric input to the written out version of the number

This is an exercise within Chris Pine's 'Learn to Program' series found here (https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_08.html) which tasks the student at creating a file which can convert numeric values to their text counterpart. The program initially works with numbers up to 99,999 but can now work with numbers up to 999,999,999 (this seemed like a reasonable place to stop).
